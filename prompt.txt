Edgar Allan Poe A Descent into the Maelström The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways; nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus. Joseph Glanville We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak. “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past, there happened to me an event such as never happened before to mortal man – or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of – and the six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a very old man – but I am not. It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?” The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge – this “little cliff” rose, a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at the sky – while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance. “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event I mentioned – and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye.” “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him – “we are now close upon the Norwegian coast – in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude – in the great province of Nordland – and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher – hold on to the grass if you feel giddy – so – and look out beyond the belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.” I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account of the Mare Tenebrarum. A panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against it its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking for ever. Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks. The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction – as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks. “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off – between Moskoe and Vurrgh – are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and Skarholm. These are the true names of the places – but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand. Do you hear any thing? Do you see any change in the water?” We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed – to its headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion – heaving, boiling, hissing – gyrating in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents. In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly – very suddenly – this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than half a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven. The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation. “This,” said I at length, to the old man – “this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.” “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.” The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene – or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle. “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea – it being constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.” In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-strom must be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ships of the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once. The attempts to account for the phenomenon – some of which, I remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal – now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Feroe islands, “have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.” – These are the words of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part – the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him – for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss. “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.” I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded. “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation – the risk of life standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital. ”We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for slackwater again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming – one that we felt sure would not fall us beforeour return – and we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents-here to-day and gone to-morrow – which drove us under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up. “I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the ground' – it is a bad spot to be in, even in good weather – but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in fishing – but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger – for, after all said and done, it was a horrible danger, and that is the truth. ”It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a day which the people of this part of the world will never forget – for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow. “The three of us – my two brothers and myself – had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock P. M., and soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven, by my watch, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström at slack water, which we knew would be at eight. ”We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most unusual – something that had never happened to us before – and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on the wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity. “In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was upon us – in less than two the sky was entirely overcast – and what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack. ”Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board if they had been sawed off – the mainmast taking with it my as I youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety. “Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this circumstance we should have foundered at once – for we lay entirely buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the foremast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this – which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done – for I was too much flurried to think. ”For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. Presently our little boatgave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard – but the next moment all this joy was turned into horror – for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word 'Moskoe-ström!' “No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well enough – I knew what he wished to make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us! ”You perceive that in crossing the Strööm channel, we always went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack – but now we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! “ To be sure,' I thought, 'we shall get there just about the slack – there is some little hope in that' – but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship. ”By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky – as clear as I ever saw – and of a deep bright blue – and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that I never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness – but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up! “I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother – but in some manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his fingers, as to say 'listen!' ”At first I could not make out what he meant – but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I glanced as its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. It had run down at seven o'clock! We were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström was in full fury! “When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip from beneath her – which appears very strange to a landsman – and this is what is called riding, in sea phrase. ”Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose – up – up – as if into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance around – and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-ström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead – but no more like the every-day Moskoe-ström, than the whirl as you now see it, is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised the place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm. “It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.

These notes will guide the subsequent drafting stages, ensuring that idiomatic meaning and literary tone are preserved while producing a natural‑sounding Czech translation.

Edgar Allan Poe Pád do Maelströmu Cesty boží jak v Přírodě, tak v činech Jeho Prozřetelnosti nepodobají se cestám našim; a naše výtvory nelze také nikterak přirovnávat k nezměrnosti, hloubce a nezbadatelnosti Jeho děl, která jsou obdařena hlubinami závratnějšími než studnice Démokritova. Joseph Glanville Konečně jsme vystoupili na vrchol nejvyššího útesu. Stařec byl zřejmě tak vyčerpán, že několik minut nemohl mluvit. „Není to tak dávno,“ řekl posléze, „co bych vás byl mohl vést po téhle cestě právě tak snadno jako můj nejmladší syn; ale asi tak před třemi roky mne potkalo něco, co ještě žádného smrtelníka nepotkalo – či co aspoň nikdo nepřežil, aby o tom mohl vyprávět – a těch šest hodin smrtelné hrůzy, které jsem tehdy zakusil, mne na těle i na duchu dočista zlomilo. Nejspíš si o mně myslíte, že jsem velmi starý člověk – ale nejsem. Stačil necelý den, aby mi tyhle vlasy, předtím černé jako uhel, zbělely, aby mi ochably nohy, povolily nervy, takže mě teď sebemenší námaha roztřese a každý stínek vystraší. Věříte, že dostávám závrať, už když se podívám z téhle skalky?“ Ta „skalka“, na jejímž okraji se natáhl tak neopatrně, že byl na její vyčnělé, kluzké hraně zaklesnut lokty – ta „skalka“, tvořící strmou, hladkou, černě svítící stěnu propasti, trčela nějakých patnáct set stop z rozeklané pustiny pod námi. Nic by mne nepřilákalo přistoupit na šest kroků k jejímu okraji. Ba poloha mého společníka mě tak rozrušila, že jsem padl jak široký, tak dlouhý na zem, sevřel trsy kolem sebe a ani se neodvážit mrknout k obloze – marně se snaže zapudit myšlenku, že prudký vítr ohrožuje samy základy hory. Dlouho mi trvalo, než jsem se jakžtakž umoudřil a sebral odvahu posadit se a pohlédnout do dálky. „Tyhle úzkosti hleďte překonat,“ řekl mi průvodce, „vždyť jsem vás sem přivedl, abyste se mohl hezky rozhlédnout po dějišti té události, o které jsem vám říkal – abyste měl to místo přímo před očima, až vám tu podivnou historii budu vypravovat. Jsme právě,“ pokračoval rozvláčným, pro něho příznačným způsobem, „jsme právě u samých břehů Norska – na osmašedesátém stupni šířky – v rozsáhlé norlandské provincii – a v smutném kraji lofotském. A sedíme zrovna na vrcholku hory, která se jmenuje Helseggen neboli Mračná. Teď se trošku zvedněte – jestli máte závrať, přidržte se trávy – tak – a podívejte se tamhle za ten pruh mlhy pod námi do moře.“ Hlava se mi motala, když jsem hleděl na širou mořskou pláň, jejíž voda měla tak inkoustovou barvu, že mi rázem vytanulo mare tenebrarum z líčení núbijského zeměpisce. Lidská fantazie si sotva dovede vytvořit truchlivější a pustší panoráma. Vpravo i vlevo, kam až oko dohlédlo, táhly se jako valy světa obrysy hrozivě černých, trčících skal, jejichž ponurost dokresloval příboj, který proti nim s věčným vytím a jekem vysoko vrhal svůj bílý, strašlivý hřbet. Přímo proti výspě, na jejímž temeni jsme seděli, asi tak pět až šest mil od nás, bylo vidět v moři pustý ostrůvek; vlastně jsme jen rozpoznávali jeho polohu podle zuřivého vlnobití, které jej svíralo. Asi o dvě míle blíž k pevnině zvedal se další ostrůvek, menší, ošklivě rozeklaný a holý, tu a tam vroubený drúzou černavých skal. Moře v prostoru mezi vzdálenějším ostrovem a pobřežím se chovalo prapodivně. Třebaže směrem k pevnině dul právě silný vichr – briga blížící se k břehům přiléhala se skasanou čelní plachtou, a i tak se celá neustále nořila do vln –, v oněch místech se nevzdouval normální příboj, tam se voda v krátkých, rychlých, vzteklých přívalech hrnula do všech stran, a to i přímo proti větru. A pěna se téměř neobjevila, jen v těsném sousedství skal. „Tomu ostrovu v dálce,“ pokračoval stařec, „říkají Norové Vurrgh. Ten prostřední je Moskoe. Tamten, asi míli na sever, je Ambaaren. A tamhle zas jsou Iflesen, Hoeyholm, Kieldholm, Suarven a Buckholm. A o kus dál – mezi Moskoem a Vurrghem – to jsou Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen a Skarholm. Tak se namouduši všechny ty ostrovy jmenují – ale proč je bylo zapotřebí vůbec pojmenovat, to ani vy, ani já nepochopíme. Slyšíte něco? Vidíte nějakou změnu ve vodě?“ Tak oběhlo prvních deset minut na vrcholku Helseggenu; vystoupili jsme na něj z lofotského vnitrozemí, a cestou jsme proto vůbec nezahlédli moře, které nás překvapilo až na nejvyšším útesu. Při starcově vyprávění jsem začal vnímat silný, znenáhla rostoucí zvuk, podobný bučení obrovského stáda bizonů na americké prérii; a již jsem si také všiml, že hladina pod námi, kterou by námořníci označili za silně zčeřenou, se prudce mění v proud směřující k východu. Přímo před mýma očima nabýval proud obludné prudkosti. Vteřinu co vteřinu se hnal rychleji, zběsileji. V pěti minutách se rozpoutala v celém prostoru až k Vurrghu nezkrotná vřava; ale nejmocněji to bouřilo mezi Moskoem a pobřežím. Zde se náhle to nesmírné řečiště, zbrázděné a proťaté tisíci svářlivými průlivy a proudy, v zběsilé křeči vzdulo, s výbuchem, varem a sykotem se roztočilo do gigantických a nesčetných vírů a v peřejích se hnalo na východ s takovou rychlostí, s jakou se vody řítí jen do propasti. Během několika dalších minut se celý výjev opět od základu změnil. Hladina se zvolna uklidňovala, vodní víry jeden za druhým mizely, teď však vznikaly mohutné šmouhy pěny, která se předtím ani neukázala. Tyto pruhy se pak dlouze protáhly, prolnuly a nakonec přejaly otáčivý pohyb ochablých vírů, jako by utvářely jádro dalšího, ještě obrovitějšího víru. A ten se také překvapivě náhle, avšak zřetelně a určitě začal rýsovat jako kruh s průměrem větším než jedna míle. Okraj kruhu tvořil široký pás třpytivé tříště; z té však ani kapka nesklouzla do jícnu děsivého trychtýče, jehož vnitřek, pokud jsme jen mohli dohlédnout, byla hladká, lesklá, černočerná vodní stěna, skloněná v úhlu dobrých pětačtyřiceti stupňů, ženoucí se opile vlnivým, vzdouvavým tryskem a volající do větru úděsným hlasem, půl jekem, půl řevem, jaký ani mocný proud Niagary ve svém smrtelném pádu nezvedá k nebesům. Hora se třásla v základech, skála se kymácela. Vrhl jsem se na tvář a v nesmírném rozrušení se chytal kdejaké travinky. „To nemůže být nic jiného,“ řekl jsem konečně starci, „než veliký vír Maelström.“ „Tak se mu taky někdy říká,“ pravil. „My Norové mu říkáme Moskoeström podle ostrova Moskoe, který je na půl cestě.“ Běžné zprávy o tomto víru mne zdaleka nepřipravily na to, co jsem spatřil. Líčení Jonase Ramuse, který je snad nejobšírnější ze všech, nemůže zprostředkovat ani tu nejkrotší představu o velkoleposti či o hrůze toho úkazu – nebo něco z omračujícího pocitu nevšednosti, který diváka zaplaví. Nevím bezpečně, odkud zmíněný autor Maelström pozoroval, ani kdy; ale jistě přitom nebyl na vrcholu Helseggenu a jistě to nebylo za bouře. Jsou však v jeho líčení místa, která mohu uvést pro jejich podrobnost, i když samozřejmě přibližují jen velmi matně dojem z té podívané. „Mezi Lofotenem a Moskoem,“ praví autor, „je moře hluboké třicet pět až čtyřicet sáhů; na druhou stranu, směrem k Veru (Vurggh), však hloubky ubývá, takže lodi tudy nemohou projíždět bez nebezpečí, že se roztříští o skaliska; to se stává i za nejklidnějšího počasí. Za přílivu proudí sice voda do úseku mezi Lofotenem a Moskoem s bouřlivou prudkostí, ale ryk jejího dravého odlivu přehluší snad i ty nejhřmotnější a nejhrozivější peřeje. Ten hluk je slyšet na několik mil, a víry a prohlubně jsou tu tak rozsáhlé a hluboké, že nevyhnutelně pohltí každou loď, která se dostane do jejich osidel, v táhnou ji ke dnu a tam ji napadrť rozbijí o skály, a teprve když se moře utiší, jsou trosky vyvrhovány nahoru. Tato mezidobí klidu nastávají ovšem jen mezi odlivem a přílivem, a to za klidného počasí, a trvají i tak jen čtvrthodinku; pak se proud rozběsňuje nanovo. A když je nejsilnější a vřavu zesílí ještě bouře, není radno přibližovat se k němu na dobrou míli. Čluny, jachty i větší lodi, které z neopatrnosti vpluly do jeho toku, byly smeteny. Často se také stává, že se k proudu až příliš blízko dostanou velryby a nápor vod se jich zmocní; a jak potom vyjí a bučí v marné snaze vyprostit se, nelze vůbec vylíčit. Jednou proud zachytil medvěda, který se pokoušel přeplavat z Lofotenu na Moskoe a byl vtažen do víru; medvěd řval tak strašlivě, že ho bylo slyšet až na pobřeží. Veliké kmeny smrků a sosen, které proud pohltil, vyplouvají na povrch tak zpřeráženy a rozdrásány, jako by z nich rostly bodliny. To dotvrzuje, že dno tvoří ostré útesy a kmeny se mezi nimi zmítají. Tento proud se řídí přílivem a odlivem – každých šest hodin se směr příboje střídá. Roku 1645 časně zrána, osmé neděle před velikonocemi, se tu rozpoutala taková vřava, že i kameny z pobřežních domů padaly na zem.“ Pokud jde o hloubku moře, nechápu, jak vůbec mohla být změřena v bezprostřední blízkosti víru. Těch „čtyřicet sáhů“ se může týkat jen úseků úžiny těsně u břehů buď Moskoeu, nebo Lofotenu. Hloubka uprostřed Moskoeströmu je jistě nesrovnatelně větší, a lépe než co jiného nás o této skutečnosti přesvědčí i boční pohled do propastného trychtýče z největšího útesu Helseggenu. Když jsem z tohoto temene hleděl na vyjící podsvětní Flegeton, musel jsem se usmívat prostoduchosti, s jakou počestný Jonas Ramus zaznamenával historky o velrybách a medvědech, jako by to bylo něco bezmála neuvěřitelného; mně totiž připadalo naprosto samozřejmé, že kdyby se i největší loď, která dnes brázdí oceány, dostala na dosah té vražedné přitažlivosti, mohla by jí stejně vzdorovat tak málo, jako peříčko vzdoruje hurikánu, a jistě by naráz beze stopy zmizela. Pokusy vysvětlit tento úkaz – některé z nich, pokud si vzpomínám, mi při čtení připadaly docela hodnověrné – se mi teď jevily v naprosto jiném a neuspokojivém světle. Všeobecně se přijímá tvrzení, že tento vír, jakož i tři menší víry mezi Faerskými ostrovy, „nemají jiné příčiny než tu, že stoupající a klesající vlny narážejí při přílivu a odlivu na hrany skal a bradel, což do té míry stlačuje vodu, že pak peřejemi vyráží; a tak čím vyšší příliv, tím hlubší je nepochybně pád, a přirozeným výsledkem toho všeho je vodní vír, jehož mohutná sací schopnost je dostatečně známá z menších pokusů“. – Tak praví Encyclopaedia Britannica. Kirchner a jiní si představují, že uprostřed maelströmské úžiny je průrva, která se zavrtává do zemské kůry a vyúsťuje kdesi daleko odtud – v jednom případě se dost rozhodně tvrdí, že je to Botnický záliv. A právě tuto domněnku, jakkoli bláhovou, má fantazie při pohledu na vír přijala nejochotněji; ale když jsem se o tom zmínil svému průvodci, překvapilo mne, že tento názor nesdílí, třebaže valná většina Norů o té věci tak smýšlí. Pokud jde o první výklad, přiznával, že mu za mák nerozumí, a já jsem s ním vlastně souhlasil – neboť ať si na papíře vypadá sebenezvratněji, je uprostřed burácení té propasti naprosto nesrozumitelný, ba nesmyslný. „Pěkně jste se na ten vír vynadíval,“ řekl stařec, „a teď se laskavě protáhněte kolem téhle skalky, abyste byl v závětří, kam tolik nedoléhá řev moře, a já vám povím příhodu, která vás přesvědčí, že bych měl něco o Moskoeströmu vědět.“ Usadil jsem se, jak si přál, a stařec pokračoval: „Míval jsem ještě se dvěma bratry dvoustěžňovou šalupu, měla asi sedmdesát tun, a s tou jsme vyjížděli na ryby mezi ostrovy za Moskoem blízko Vurrghu. Ve všech prudkých protiproudech na moři se dá ve vhodnou dobu slušně lovit, jen když má člověk dost odvahy pustit se tam, jenže, jak vám povídám, ze všech lidí na lofotenském pobřeží jsme se jedině my tři vydávali pravidelně až k těm ostrovům. Obyčejně se jezdí lovit o hodný kus níž na jih. Tam se ryba chytne, kdy si vzpomenete, a bez nebezpečí, a proto je to oblíbenější lovistě. Ale tam, na těch našich vyhlídnutých místech mezi skálami, se vytáhnou nejen ty nejlepší kusy, ale taky v daleko větším množství, takže jsme často za pouhý den nalovili tolik, kolik bázlivější mládenci nesehnali do kupy ani za týden. Vlastně to bylo od nás taková zoufalá spekulace – místo dřiny jsme hazardovali životem, naším kapitálem byla odvaha. Kotvili jsme se šalupou v malé zátoce asi pět mil odtud podél břehu nahoru; a mívali jsme ve zvyku využívat za pěkného počasí té čtvrthodinové přestávky mezi přílivem a odlivem k tomu, že jsme se rychle přeplavili přes hlavní úžinu Moskoeströmu, hodný kus nad prohlubní, a pak jsme spustili kotvu někde poblíž Otterholmu nebo Sandflesenu, kde spodní proudy nejsou tak divoké jako jinde. Tam jsme zůstávali, a teprve krátce před dalším itšením jsme vyplouvali zpátky domů. Nikdy jsme tuhle výpravu nepodnikali, jestliže nám nevál na cestu tam i zpátky stálý boční vítr – vítr, o kterém se dalo s jistotou říct, že nás před návratem nenechá na holičkách – a v tom jsme se taky zřídkakdy přepočítali. Za šest let jsme jen dvakrát museli celou noc kotvit na jednom místě pro úplné bezvětří, kterí právě v těchhle končinách je opravdu vzácné; a jednou jsme museli na lovišti zůstat a trápit se hladem skoro týden zas kvůli smršti, která propukla krátce potom, co jsme tam dorazili, a tak rozbouřila průliv, že na návrat nebylo pomyšlení. Tenkrát by nás to bylo zaneslo na širé moře dělej co dělej (víry nás totiž proháněly kolem dokola tak zběsile, že jsme nakonec spustili kotvu a vlekli ji za sebou), kdybychom byli náhodou nevpluli do jednoho z té spousty příčných proudů, co se tam jeden den objeví a zíta už jsou pryč – nu, a ten nás pak zahnal až do závětří Flimenu, u kterého jsme naštěstí přistáli. Já vám nevypovím ani dvacetinu těžkostí, které nás trápily přímo na lovišti – je tam člověku mizerně i za pěkného počasí –, ale vždycky jsme se hleděli protlouct bez pohromy aspoň tím peklem Moskoeströmu, ačkoli jsem občas míval taky srdce v kalhotách, když jsme se tam dostali nějakou tu minutu před nebo po začátku utišení. Někdy vítr nebýval tak silný, jak jsme si mysleli při vyplutí, a pak jsme zdaleka nedopluli tam, kam jsme chtěli, a šalupa se v tom proudu nedala ovládat. Můj nejstarší bratr měl osmnáctiletého syna a já jsem měl taky dva statné chlapce. V takových chvílích by se mohli chopit vesel a i později při lovu by nám mohli pomáhat, ale něměli jsme to srdce vystavovat mladé nebezpečí, když už jsme riskovali sami – protože, když se to tak vezme, bylo to hrozné nebezpečí, to mi věřte. Za pár dní to budou tři roky, co se stalo to, o čem vám teď budu povídat. Bylo to desátého července a na ten den lidi v těchhle končinách do smrti nezapomenou, protože tenkrát zuřil nejstrašnější orkán, jaký kdy nebesa seslala; a přece celé dopoledne, a dokonce hodný kus odpůldne vál jen slabounký a stálý větřík od jihozápadu a k tomu zářilo slunce, takže ani nejzkušenější mořeplavec mezi námi nemohl předvídat, co pak přišlo. My tři – moji dva bratři a já – jsme přepluli k ostrovům kolem druhé hodiny s poledne a brzy jsme měli skoro vrchovatou šalupu samých pěkných ryb, kterých – to jsme si všimli – bylo ten den mnohem víc než kdykoli předtím. Na mých hodinkách bylo právě sedm, když jsme zvedli kotvu a vypluli domů, abychom zase nejhorší úsek strömu proplouvali v mezidobí klidu, které mělo nastat v osm hodin. Vyrazili jsme za čerstvého větru z pravého boku a chvíli jsme čile uháněli vpřed; na nebezpečí jsme si ani nevzpomněli, opravdu nebyl nejmenší důvod k obavám. Znenadání nás však překvapil vítr, který vál od Helseggenu. To bylo něco naprosto nebývalého, co se nám až dosud nepřihodilo, a taky jsem začal být drobátko neklidný, i když jsem nevěděl proč. Natočili jsme loď k větru, ale nemohli jsme se hnout z místa kvůli protiproudům; už jsem chtěl navrhnout, abychom se vrátili na naše kotviště, vtom jsme ale za zády spatřili obzor celý pokrytý prazvláštním měděným mrakem, který se s úžasnou rychlostí rozrůstal. Větřík, který se vzdul proti nám, mezitím utichl, takže jsme byli najednou v naprostém bezvětří a moře si s námi dělalo, co chtělo. Tenhle stav netrval dlouho – ani jsme neměli čas o něm uvažovat. Neuplynula minuta a přepadla nás bouře – do dvou minut se obloha úplně zatáhla –, a když se k tomu přihnala ještě vodní tříšť, udělala se náhle taková tma, že jsme jeden druhého na lodi ani neviděli. Bylo by bláhové chtít vám vylíčit hurikán, který se tenkrát rozpoutal. Nejstarší námořník v Norsku nikdy nic podobného nezažil. Než nás to naplno zasáhlo, stačili jsme ještě honem svinout plachty, ale už první náraz nám urazil oba stěžně, zrovna jako by je přeťal, a hlavní stěžeň vzal s sebou i mého nejmladšího bratra, který se k němu pro jistotu přivázal. Naše loď byla něco tak lehoučkého – nu, hotové pírko na vodě. Palubu měla hladkou, bez přístavků, až na malý poklop na přídi, který jsme před plavbou přes ström vždycky pevně zatloukli – pro případ, že by se vlny moc vzdouvaly. Nebýt toho, byli bychom naráz ztroskotali – protože na chvíli se voda nad námi dočista zavřela. Jak můj starší bratr unikl záhubě, to vám nepovím, poněvadž jsem to už nikdy nemohl zjistit. Pokud se mne týká, jakmile jsem strhl přední plachtu, plácl jsem sebou na palubu, vzepřel se nohama o nízké brlení na přídi a rukama jsem popadl kruhový svorník u paty předního stěžně. Udělal jsem to naprostoo pudově – a podle všeho to bylo to nejlepší, co jsem mohl udělat –, protože na nějaké přemýšlení jsem byl až moc vyplašený. Chvíli jsme byli, jak povídám, úplně pod vodou, a celý ten čas jsem zadržoval dech a svíral svorník. Když už jsem to nemohl vydržet, klekl jsem si – aniž jsem se ovšem pustil kruhu, a tak jsem si uvolnil hlavu. Potom se náš člun zatřepal zrovna jako pes, když vyleze z vody, a tak se aspoň trochu zbavil té záplavy. Snažil jsem se teď překonat mrákoty, které na mě padly, vzít rozum do hrsti a rozmyslet si, co dál – a tu mne kdosi uchopil za rameno. Byl to můj starší bratr. Srdce mi poskočilo radostí, protože jsem ho už viděl v moři – ale v příští vteřině se má radost proměnila v děs – neboť bratr přiblížil ústa těsně k mému uchu a vykřikl jen jedno slovo: ‚Moskoeström!‘ Nikdo nikdy nepochopí, co jsem v tu chvíli prožíval. Roztřásl jsem se od hlavy k patě, jako bych měl prudký záchvat zimnice. Až moc dobře jsem si uvědomil, co tím jedním slovem myslí – věděl jsem, co mi tím chce naznačit. S větrem, který nás teď hnal, jsme nezadržitelně mířili do víru strömu a nic nás nemohlo zachránit! Víte dobře, jak jsme úžinu strömu přeplouvali vždycky daleko nad vírem, i když bylo překrásně, a jak jsme pak bedlivě vyčkávali klidné chvilky mezi příbojem – a teď si představte, že jsme se řítili rovnou do té prohlubně, a ještě v takovém orkánu! Ale jedna věc je jistá, pomyslil jsem si, doplujeme tam zrovna v tom utišení – aspoň ždibínek naděje tu je –, ale vzápětí jsem se proklínal, co jsem to za blázna, když ještě bláhově uvažuju o naději. Dobře jsem věděl, že je s námi konec, i kdybychom byli velelodí s devadesáti kanóny na palubě. Tou dobou první zuřivý nápor vichřice už ochabl, anebo jsme ji tolik nepociťovali, protože jsme kouzali před ní, ale buď jak buď vlny, které až dosud vítr srážel, uhlazoval a zpěňoval, se teď vzedmuly v učiněné hory. Také na obloze nastala podivná změna. Kolem nás bylo pořád tma jako v pytli, ale tkařka nad hlavou se zničehonic protrhla kulatá díra a v ní bylo jasné nebe – v životě jsem neviděl tak sytou, jasnou, tak čistou modř – a tou dírou prozařoval měsíc v úplňku a tak se vám třpytil, jak jsem ho třpytit ještě neviděl. Všechno kolem nás naprosto zřetelně ozářil – ale panebože, byla to podívaná, co ozařoval! Několikrát jsem se pokusil na bratra promluvit, ale hukot se najednou tak vzmohl – aniž jsem chápal proč –, že bratr neslyšel jediné slovo, třebaže jsem mu z plných plic křičel do ucha. Pak zavrtěl hlavou a bledý jako stěna zdvihl ukazovák, jako by chtěl říci: ‚Poslouchej!‘ Zprvu jsem nechápal, co tím myslí – brzy mi však kmitla hlavou šeredná myšlenka. Vytáhl jsem z kapsy hodinky. Nešly. Za svitu měsíce jsem pohlédl na jejich ciferník – vytryskly mi slzy a mrštil jsem hodinky daleko do moře. Zastavily se v sedm hodin! Už jsme zmeškali utišení příboje a vír strömu teď běsní naplno! Když je loď dobře stavěná, řádně vyvážená a nepřetížená, a pluje-li v silné vichřici s plnými plachtami, vždycky se zdá, jako by vlny zpod ní klouzaly – což člověku z pevniny připadá velmi podivné. V námořnické hantýrce se tomu říká ‚jízda‘. Tedy až dosud se nám jízda po vzdutých vlnách hezky dařila, ale najednou nás obrovská vlna popadla zrovna pod kormou, a jak se zdvihala, vynášela nás s sebou bůhvíkam nahoru – výš a výš. Nikdy bych byl nevěřil, že může vlna vystoupit tak vysoko. A pak jsme sjížděli dolů, zhoupili se, klouzali a řítili se, až mi bylo zle a tak mdlo, jako bych ve snu padal z nějaké vysokánské hory. Když jsme však byli nahoře, rychle jsem se rozhlédl kolem – a ten krátký pohled mi úplně stačil. Rázem jsem poznal naši přesnou polohu. Vír Moskoeströmu byl asi čtvrt míle rovnou před námi – ale podobal se tak málo denně vídanému Moskoeströmu, jako se tamhleten vír, co na něj koukáte, podobá mlýnskému náhonu. Kdybych byl nevěděl, kde asi jsme a co nás čeká, byl bych to místo vůbec nepoznal. A tak jsem s hrůzou bezděky zavřel oči. Víčka se mi sama jakoby v křeči sevřela. Snad neuběhly ani dvě minuty a náhle jsme pocítili, že vlny klesají; také nás obklopovala pěna. Loď sebou prudce trhla doleva a jako blesk vystřelila novým směrem.
